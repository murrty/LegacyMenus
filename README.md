# LegacyMenus
Reimplements the ContextMenu and MainMenu controls in .NET versions above .NET Core 3.0.

This is a direct modification of [Paint.NET's reimplementation](https://github.com/paintdotnet/System.Windows.Forms.Legacy) which removes unnecessary classes, incomplete nullable values, and native image support for the menu items.

I expect you to know how to implement these for yourself, don't ask me how to use them.
